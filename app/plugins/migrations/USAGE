  cake migrate
  
    - Migrates to the latest version (the last migration file)

  cake migrate [version number]
  
    - Migrates to the version specified [version number]
    
      Example:  This will migrate up or down to version 2.
    
        $ cake migrate 2

  cake migrate generate|gen|g [migration name]
  
    - Generates a migration file with the given name [migration name]

      [migration name] must be alphanumeric, but can include spaces, hyphens and underscores.
      
      Example:  This will generate a migration file called '001_my_first_migration.yml'
      
        $ cake migrate g my_first_migration

  cake migrate generate|gen|g from db [table1 table2 ...]
  
    - Generates a migration file for the specified table(s). The YAML is generated from the actual
      database table.

      If no tables are passed, it generates one single migration file called full_schema.yml using
      your current database tables.
      
      Example:  This will generate a migration file for each given table name (which must already
                exist in the DB), and populate the file with the schema found in each table.
      
        $ cake migrate g from db users groups
        
      Example:  This will generate a 'full_schema.yml' migration file, containing the schema for all
                existing tables in your database.
      
        $ cake migrate g from db

  cake migrate generate|gen|g sessions
  
    - Generates the cake sessions table.

  cake migrate generate|gen|g create table_name
  
    - Generates a migration file that will create a table with the given underscored table_name.
    
      Example:  This will generate a migration file called '001_create_users.yml' and will attempt to
                build the default YAML to create a table called 'users'.
