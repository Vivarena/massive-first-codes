        <p>The mission of Vivarena is to connect the business world’s entrepreneurs, investors, advisors, professionals, and service providers to meet, communicate, learn, collaborate, find opportunities and make better decisions leveraging their network of trusted social relationships.</p>
        <p>Registering with Vivarena means sharing information about yourself with others, communicating with them, and working privately. Your account is initially set up to share the information that we believe the majority of our Users are interested in sharing. But the type and amount of information you decide to share, and with whom you share it, is up to you.</p>
        <p>Information about you consists of:</p>
        <p><i>Profile Information.</i> This is the information that your connections, other members, and companies see about you. This includes your profile information and may also include any files, images, links or documents you may have uploaded.  <strong>You can update your information at any time and you can decide whom you share your information with.</strong></p>
        <p><i>Communications</i>, Messaging and Sharing. Vivarena is designed to help you communicate with your connections. Some of this is one-to-one, some of it is in groups, and some of it is public discussion. We receive information about you when you communicate with others as well as when others communicate with you or about you.  This includes your contributions to other community features Vivarena may offer such as “Suggestions” and “Polls.” <strong>You decide how much you wish to communicate and in what forum.</strong></p>
        <p><i>Activity and Behavior.</i> Your information also includes the information you create by your activity on the site, such as when you post a status update, add a connection to your network, make a suggestion or answer a poll. In addition to the content included in your behavior, your information may include the behavioral act itself. We also provide tools that you can use privately on Vivarena (for example, searching for another member).  <strong>You decide who sees your activity on the site.</strong></p>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by means of a notice on our home page so that you may access and review the changes to this document in advance of your continued use of the service. If you object to any changes, you may <u>close your account</u>. By continuing to use the Vivarena service after notice of changes has been sent to you or published on the Vivarena website, you are consenting to the changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Vivarena’ Privacy Policy Includes:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>What we collect
          <p>Vivarena makes features and functionalities available through our website, provided as part of the Vivarena services (“Services”) to enable Users to meet, communicate, learn, find opportunities, make better decisions and distribute information in collaboration with one another. By joining Vivarena, you voluntarily and willingly provide Vivarena Holdings, inc. in Miami, Florida, USA, certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the Vivarena website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a member of the Vivarena community; and, if you are already a member, you should close your account.  We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Registration</i>
            <p>In order to become a User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, and password. Without this minimal amount of information, you cannot create an Vivarena account. Like other passwords, you should choose one that is known only by you. Vivarena requests other information from you during the profile editing process, (e.g., gender, location, etc.) that Vivarena uses to provide better, more customized services such as language-specific profile pages and updates. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on Vivarena you allow others, including Vivarena, to identify you and to allow Vivarena to use your information in accordance with our <a href="/terms">User Agreement</a>.</p></li>
            <li><i>Profile Information </i>
            <p>Once you become a User, you may provide additional information to your Vivarena Profile describing your skills, professional experiences, educational background, recommendations from other Vivarena Users, group memberships, and networking objectives (among other options). Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is minimally required at registration is entirely up to you, but providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from Vivarena and your professional network by helping you build your professional identity and leverage your professional network and facilitating your search for professional resources, information, and new opportunities. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section may be used by Vivarena as described in the <a href="/terms">User Agreement</a> and this Privacy Policy. If you decide not to share certain information, you may not receive the full benefit of being a Vivarena User.</p></li>
            <li><i>Contacts Information</i>
            <p>In order to connect with others on Vivarena, you may use the Services to send invitations either to their Vivarena profiles or email addresses of people you know if they have not registered with Vivarena. The names and email addresses of people whom you invite will be used to send your invitations and reminders as well as to allow Vivarena to help expand your network. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another User, that User may have access to your email address. Your Vivarena connections may also have access to your email address. You should not invite anyone you do not know and trust to connect with you.  By providing email addresses or other information of non-Users to Vivarena, you represent that you have authority to do so. All information that you enter or upload about your contacts is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy and will enable us to provide customized services such as suggesting people to connect with on Vivarena. </p>
            <li><i>Customer Service </i>
            <p>We collect information when you <a href="/contact-us">Contact us</a> in order to accurately categorize and respond to customer inquiries and investigate breaches of our terms.</p></li>
            <li><i>Using the Vivarena Site </i>
            <p>We receive information when you interact with and use the Vivarena website.  For example, we know when you click on a link, upload your address book, add a contact, participate in polls, etc. </p></li>
            <li><i>Cookies </i>
            <p>Like most websites, we use cookies and web log files to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, to customize your experience on Vivarena.  A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you as a User when you return to the Vivarena website using the same computer and web browser. You can remove or block cookies using the settings in your browser, but in some cases doing so may impact your ability to use Vivarena. A cookie is set once you’ve logged in to your Vivarena account. The next time you visit the Vivarena website, the cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing User so you will not need to log in before using the Services. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. </p></li>
            <li><i>Log files, IP Addresses and information about your computer and mobile device</i>
            <p>When you visit the Vivarena website we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave Vivarena.  Vivarena may also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device (including your UDID) and mobile operating system (if you are accessing Vivarena using a mobile device), as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. Vivarena may also receive location data passed to it from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have enabled. </p></li>
            <li><i>Rights to Modify Information About You</i>
            <p>You have a right to access, modify, correct and eliminate the data you supplied to Vivarena. If you update any of your information, we may keep a copy of the information that you originally provided to us in our archives for uses documented in this policy. You may request deletion of your information at any time by <a href="/contact-us">contacting Vivarena</a>. We will respond to your request within 30 days. Please note, however that information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible even if you request its deletion.</p></li>
            <li><i>Data Retention </i>
            <p>Vivarena will retain your information for so long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  If you wish to close your account, you may do so <u>here</u>. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce this Agreement.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <li><p><b>How we use it</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Consent to Vivarena Processing Information About You </i>
            <p>The information you provide to Vivarena may reveal, or allow others to identify, your nationality, ethnic origin, gender, age, and other aspects of your life. By providing information to us for the purposes of creating your User account or adding any additional details to your Vivarena profile, you are expressly and voluntarily accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and <a href="/terms">Vivarena’ User Agreement</a> that allow Vivarena to process information about you. Supplying information to Vivarena, including any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law, is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw your consent to Vivarena’ collection and processing of your information at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement by <u>closing your account</u>, but please note that your withdrawal of consent will not be retroactive.</p>
            <li><i>Vivarena Communications</i>
            <p>As described in the User Agreement, we will communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Vivarena website, messages to your Vivarena inbox, or through other means available. We may send you emails that help inform new Users about the features of the Services, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services.  Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving service messages from Vivarena. Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you understand you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges).</p></li>
            <li><i>User Communications</i>
            <p>Many communications you initiate through Vivarena (e.g., an invitation sent to a non-User) may contain your thumbnail image, primary email address, and name. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about you (for instance how many people are in your network, or who is also included in a group). Other communications that you initiate through the Vivarena website, like a post on another Members’ activity, may list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information unless you indicate so.  We may keep copies of any such communications in order to comply with any regulatory agency, or enforce the terms of this Policy or the Terms of Service Agreement.</p></li>
            <li><i>Customized Content</i>
            <p>We use information you provide to us (or to third parties with whom Vivarena offers combined services) to customize your experience on our website. For example, when you login to your account, we will display the names of new Users who have recently joined your network or recent status updates from your connections. </p></li>
            <li><i>Sharing Information with Third Parties</i>
            <p>Vivarena takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy. We will also not share other personal information not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Vivarena services (Suggestions, Polls, etc.) unless, disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Vivarena, our Users or the public.</p>
            <p>Vivarena offers a “public profile” feature that allows Users to publish portions of their Vivarena profile to the public internet. This public profile will be crawled by and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name. You may set limits to this feature by <a href="/profile/edit">editing your profile</a>; however, Vivarena does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.  Content distributed through Vivarena’s sharing features and third party integrations may result in displaying some of your information outside of Vivarena. For example, when you post content to a Vivarena Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. Or, if you have bound your Vivarena account to your Facebook, LinkedIn or Twitter account, you can easily share content into both Vivarena as well as to Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.</p>
            <p>We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers or Members.</p></li>
            <li><i>Polls</i>
            <p>Polls may be conducted by Vivarena, on behalf of Vivarena, Vivarena Users or third parties. As a User, whether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you.  After you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page.  We will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third parties in connection with the conduct of any polls or surveys. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it, if required or requested.</p></li>
            <li><i>Search</i>
            <p>We may offer search services to help find information and other Users. Vivarena search also allows Users to more effectively use Vivarena and expand their network. We may use information from User profiles and contributions to community features to inform and refine our search service.</p></li>
            <li><i>Testimonials and Advertisements Placed through Vivarena Ads Service</i>
            <p>If you provide any testimonials about the Vivarena Services, we may post those testimonials in connection with our promotion of the Website and Services to third parties. Testimonials may include your name and other personal information that you have provided.</p></li>
            <li><i>Compliance with Legal Process</i>
            <p>It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information and/or information about your activities as an Vivarena User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if Vivarena has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Vivarena, our Users, employees, or others. </p></li>
            <li><i>Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of Vivarena Corporation</i>
            <p>We may also disclose your personal information and other information you provide to another third party as part of a sale of the assets of Vivarena, a subsidiary or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company. Any third party to which Vivarena transfers or sells Vivarena’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <li><p><b>Your Choices</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Accessing and Changing Your Account Information</i>
            <p>You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your Vivarena account including your email and privacy preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the Vivarena website and editing your profile. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, Vivarena may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database.</p></li>
            <li><i>Default Settings </i>
            <p>Because the mission of Vivarena is to connect the world’s professionals to enable them to become more productive and successful, we have established what we believe to be reasonable default settings that we have found most professionals desire. Because Users may use and interact with Vivarena in a variety of ways, and because those uses may change over time, we designed our settings to provide our users granular control over the information they share. We encourage our Users to review their account settings and adjust them in accordance with their preferences.</p></li>
            <li><i>Closing Your Account</i>
            <p>You can close your account through the Vivarena customer <a href="/profile/edit">profile editing options</a>. If you close your Vivarena account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. However, we may retain certain data contributed by you if Vivarena believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. Vivarena may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, messages you send on Vivarena to other Users, as well as your post and comments you’ve made on other profiles, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. Vivarena disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. Vivarena does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from Vivarena’s publicly viewable database.</p></li>
            <li><i>Memorializing Accounts</i>
            <p>If we learn that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User’s account. In these cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so.</p></li></ol>
          <li><strong>Your Obligations</strong>
          <p>As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become commonplace in user-friendly communities of like-minded members such as Vivarena:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and User Agreement. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties (such as trademarks or photographs).</li>
            <li>You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of Vivarena and its community of Users.</li>
            <li>You must not provide to Vivarena and/or other Users information that you believe might be injurious or detrimental to your person or to your professional or social status.</li>
            <li>You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of your account at the sole discretion of Vivarena.</p>
          <li><p><b>Important information</b></p>
          <ol>
            <li><i>Children and Minors</i>
            <p>Children under the age of 18 are not eligible to use our service.</p></li>
            <li><i>Changes to this Privacy Policy</i>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time, with or without advance notice. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personally identifiable information, or in the Privacy Policy document itself, we will display a notice on the Vivarena website or send you an email, so that you may review the changed terms prior to continuing to use the site. As always, if you object to any of the changes to our terms, and you no longer wish to use Vivarena, you may <u>close your account</u>. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that Vivarena has about you and your account.  Using the Vivarena Services after a notice of changes has been sent to you or published on our site shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <li><strong>Security</strong>
          <p>In order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on Vivarena is password-protected.  To protect any data you store on our servers, Vivarena also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a secured-access data center. However, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Vivarena. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails and similar means of communication with other Users of Vivarena are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means.</p></li>
        </ol>
